# Proposal 4: Re-enable the Neutaro-Osmo IBC Client

> NeutaroGuardian Voted: [YES](https://nms1.neutaro.tech/Neutaro/tx/26CF2FC115EC99F50B0B25E28D87BAB5F7A206989104FEE7EF03EA4FE15C9E99)

### Description
The Timpi Development Team would like to request we re-enable the Neutaro-Osmosis Inter-blockchain Communication (IBC)

#### Arguments In-Favor
The proposal addresses the topic of the Neutaro-Osmo communication on IBC. The client used for this communication has expired, and we need to refresh it to reestablish the Neutaro-Osmo connection.

With Osmo being one of the key chains within the IBC ecosystem, it is crucial that the connection to Neutaro can run without issues. NTMPI tokens were transferred to Osmo earlier, and now that the client has expired, they are blocked. Refreshing the client will unblock them—this is also why we cannot simply install a new client, as the previously transferred tokens would be lost. Additionally, the proposal will allow us to explore further cooperation with Osmo in the future.

#### Arguments Against
I did not hear argument against prior to my vote.

### My Thoughts
IBC or Inter-Blockchain Communication, is a protocol that allows different blockchains to communicate and transfer data assets between each other. I believe IBC is critical for the network to be able to increase access and ubiquity. Because Osmo is one of the key chains in the Cosmos network and we already have NTMPI tokens distributed there, we should re-enable this connection for the betterment of Neutaro.

I did ask the following questions regarding the proposal prior to my vote. I believe these questions and responses below are important points for our validator community to consider with this specific proposal.
1. Is the proposed IBC client connection with Osmo going to require any additional resources, ie. network, disk, cpu, or mem that might suggest the validator community need to increase the provisioned hardware requirements for hosting the neutaro validator?
    - No, the proposed re-enabling of the IBC client with Osmo will not require any additional resources such as network, disk, CPU, or memory. Therefore, there’s no need for the validator community to increase the provisioned hardware requirements for hosting the Neutaro validator.
2. Any other confirmed details for future opportunities of interest with the Osmo partnership? (I'm for IBC, just curious if there are urgent priorities in the works the speak the added value)
    - Currently, our primary goal is to “free” the tokens that are already on Osmo by re-enabling the client. While we are supportive of IBC and exploring further opportunities with Osmo, there are no urgent priorities or confirmed details beyond this immediate need.
3. Does this tie Neutaro to any governance requirements or constraints of Osmo that are out of control of Neutaro governance?
    - No, this proposal does not tie Neutaro to any governance requirements or constraints from Osmo that are beyond Neutaro’s control. Our neutaro-ibc-token-on-osmo is tied to the client. We could also create a new client ( and connection etc ), but then the tokens that were send using the first client are lost

Considering these points, I believe it is fair and reasonable approve this proposal and re-enable the IBC client without undue risk to the chain.
