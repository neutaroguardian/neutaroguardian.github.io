# Proposal 3: Upgrading the Neutaro Binary

> NeutaroGuardian Voted: [YES](https://explorer.neutaro.io/Neutaro/tx/DAF4E2665AA6AE8831BADEB543CE40C0C6BF9E3AF4182763332705CE8AACD161)

### Description
The Timpi Development Team would like to request upgrading the current Neutaro binary from SDK v0.45.6 to v0.47.1

#### Arguments In-Favor
The proposal is to approve the blockchain upgrade, a crucial step toward launching the NFTs for the dashboard. This upgrade will enable us to introduce expiring NFTs for managing premium features on a yearly subscription basis.

We are upgrading to:
* A new binary version.
* This allows us to use a new version of the WASM module, which allows us to offer more and different NFTs.

There are a few extras that comes with the upgrade because these are now standard. This includes for example,
* Multi send in the bank module
* Vesting
* An easier process to generate a gov proposal
* Better formatting/ readability on a node/CLI

We have been testing the binary and haven't found anything that is of concern.

#### Arguments Against
I did not hear argument against prior to my vote.

### My Thoughts
I can understand the interest to upgrade the blockchain. Latest features and bug fixes are almost always worth taking unless there is a specific change in direction that the community would request we fork and go a different route.

With just this simple upgrade though, I'm almost surprised we need to vote, but do appreciate as it raises attention to validator hosts to upgrade timely as required.

Considering these points, I believe it is fair and reasonable to upgrade to the a newer version without putting undue risk to the chain.

## Commitement to Governance Voting
Those delegating **deserve transparency** for how their shares are voting. As a committed contributor to Neutaro and Timpi, I will be participating in all governance voting.  I will post description of each proposal when announced, share my thoughts, and **explain how I'm casting the vote for the shares delegated**.
