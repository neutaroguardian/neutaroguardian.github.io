Hi! I'm an early beta tester, multiple NFT holder, node operator, and huge supporter of **[Timpi.io](https://timpi.io/)**.  I'm really excited about this project and proud to be [hosting a validator](https://nms1.neutaro.tech/Neutaro/staking/neutarovaloper1usjfenq4kfjvtml4v845xlweeekdhpyn77ndz9) that secures the **[$NTIMPI](https://timpi.io/timpi-token/)** token on the **[neutaro](https://neutaro.com/)** blockchain. For the first 12 months from the Token Distribution Event (TDE) in Feb '24, anyone can delegate for **[an additional 17% APY on top of their share of block rewards](#staking-and-delegating-on-neutaro)**. [Full details](#staking-and-delegating-on-neutaro) below [how-to delegate](#how-to-delegate) and earn.

[$NTIMPI is currently available for purchase on OraiDEX.io](https://oraidex.io/?from=ibc/576B1D63E401B6A9A071C78A1D1316D016EC9333D2FEB14AD503FAC4B8731CD1&to=usdt)

The token will be launching early March on [BitMart](https://www.bitmart.com/).  [Look here for current full details on how you can buy $NTIMPI.](https://timpi.io/timpi-token/)

Everyone can **earn $NTIMPI as rewards** through hosting and operating **[Timpi Node NFTs that support the network.](https://timpi.io/NFT-marketplace/?coupon=nwbower0)** More NFTs will becoming available soon during the upcoming [APEX Events](https://timpi.io/apex-events/) and planned [Airdrops](https://timpi.io/airdrops/).

> **Latest news** for [upcoming marketing events published here](https://timpi.io/2024/02/16/key-marketing-events/).

Excited to be supporting the future of decentralized data and search.

#### Guardian Validator Uptime and Availability
This validator is hosted with full 24/7/365 availability, 1GB connectivity, and redundant power backup.

#### Commitement to Governance Voting
Those delegating **deserve transparency** for how their shares are voting. As a committed contributor to neutaro and Timpi, I will be participating in all governance voting.  I will post description of each proposal when announced, share my thoughts, and **explain how I'm casting the vote for the shares delegated**. 

#### Staking and Delegating on Neutaro
 $NTIMPI holders can contribute to the governance of Timpi, itâ€™s future, and the security of the neutaro chain. For your contribution in the first 12 months since Feb '24, delegators will earn an **additional 17% APY** on top of their share of block rewards. ([promotion details](https://timpi.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-stake-to-a-Neutaro-Validator-v1.0.pdf))
