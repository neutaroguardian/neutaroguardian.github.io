Hi! I'm an early beta tester, multiple NFT holder, node operator, and huge supporter of [Timpi.io](https://timpi.io/).  I'm really excited about this project and proud to be [hosting a validator](https://nms1.neutaro.tech/Neutaro/staking/neutarovaloper1usjfenq4kfjvtml4v845xlweeekdhpyn77ndz9) that secures the $NTIMPI token on the [neutaro](https://neutaro.com/) blockchain. For the first 12 months anyone can delegate for [17% APY](https://timpi.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-stake-to-a-Neutaro-Validator-v1.0.pdf). 

Everyone can earn $NTIMPI as rewards through hosting and operating [Timpi Nodes that support the network.](https://timpi.io/NFT-marketplace/?coupon=nwbower0) More access NFTs will be available soon during the upcoming [APEX Events](https://timpi.io/apex-events/) and planned [Airdrops](https://timpi.io/airdrops/).

Excited to be supporting the future of decentralized data and search.
